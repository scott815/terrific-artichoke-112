          The fund will incur no annual management fee. Further, there will be
          no performance fees attached due to the passive nature of the fund. As
          a result of zero performance fee, there is no specific benchmark the
          fund aims to outperform. For comparative purposes however, the fund
          will be benchmarked against the performance of the top 20 cryptoassets
          equally weighted and Bitcoin itself.
